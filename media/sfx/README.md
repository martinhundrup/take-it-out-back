# Sound Effects

Place your sound files here:

- **cock.mp3** — Played when selecting / right-clicking a process (shotgun cocking)
- **fire.mp3** — Played when executing any kill command (shotgun firing)

Supported formats: `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.aiff` (anything `afplay` on macOS or `paplay`/`aplay` on Linux can handle).

You can also override these paths in VS Code settings:
- `takeitoutback.sfx.pathCock`
- `takeitoutback.sfx.pathFire`
